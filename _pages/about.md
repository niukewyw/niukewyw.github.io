## About Me

Hello! My name is Yaowu Wang. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at the College of Computer and Software, Hohai University (Class of 2022), and I will obtain my Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2026. I have been recommended for postgraduate study and will be joining the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Southeast University to pursue a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

My current research interests include reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and their applications. In the future, I aim to explore multi-agent systems based on large language models.

I have led or participated in the publication of 4 academic papers. You can find more details about my works on my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0009-0004-3576-5764).
