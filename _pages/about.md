Hello! My name is Yaowu Wang. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at the College of Computer and Software, Hohai University (Class of 2022), and I will obtain my Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2026. I have been recommended for postgraduate study and will be joining the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Southeast University to pursue a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

My current research interests include reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and their applications. In the future, I aim to explore multi-agent systems based on large language models.
